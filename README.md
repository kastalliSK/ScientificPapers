# ScientificPapers
This project presents a pipeline for the identification of the structure of scientific papers. 
Large journals share explicitly their guidelines so participants know exactly how to structure their publicationsbut in most of the medium size conference 
these guidelines arenot explicitly described so participants usually go with the wayprevious work has been presented.
The idea of this paper is to build a pipeline to retrieve effective and valid information from scientific articles belonging to different small size conferences. 
The goal is to find their guidelines. The process of identification of the structure of scientific articles in this work starts with data acquisition, 
data preprocessing, feature extraction and finally evaluation of the features. A statistical analysis over the quantitative features shows some similarity 
across conferences and also identifies the features that distinguish them from each other. At the end, the paper uses a classification algorithm that aims 
to evaluate the importance of the extracted features in the classification of papers in the right conferences which give us the most important characteristics of aconference.

# Objective
We aim to understand if small to medium sized con-ferences have common structure by doing a comparison study ofthe validity of the features for each
conference and highlightingthe most important ones.
# Contribution: 
We contribute a study exploring the common structure of articles from different small
conferences in order to generate a set of requirements for the general structure of an article. In this project we create an end-to-end pipeline for structure analysis. 
It contains an effortless process for data collection and parsing. 
Inaddition, we provide an undemanding and flexible process for datacleaning and feature extraction, and output ready for many statisti-cal models.
